http and fpt and smtp and websocket are different communication channels;

http is a oneway communication where only client can only request to server then server response to client,
 

but in websocket is a way where you create a connection between your client and server, and in this connection even server can send notification to client as well without any request;
------------------------------------------

socket.io is a library of websocket. which use to make is simpler to user of websocket/
----------------

io is like a main circet and socket is like a subpart of it, in an io there could be many sockets

when we send something from io it automatically goes to all sockets.
and to recent any event we use socket.on or io.on event this thing is use to receive any event.


EMIT: 
this is use to send any event for example socket.emit("date);
ON:
this is use to receive any event example socket.on("date");
BROADCAST:
to send any event to all socket except the senders,
IO:
is same but we send it from backend and it send event to all sockets,
TO:
to send event to particular socket;
JOIN:
this is use to make a group of different socket then you can send same event to different socket that you join to then you use TO event to send notification to particular group of socket
